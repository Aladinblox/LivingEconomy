# LivingEconomy Currency Definitions
#
# Each currency should have a unique key (e.g., "gold", "emerald_shards").
# Properties:
#   name: Display name of the currency (e.g., "Gold Coin")
#   symbol: Short symbol for the currency (e.g., "G", "$")
#   texture: (Optional) Path to a .png file in LivingEconomy/currencies/ for custom item textures.
#            If using a custom item model, this might be used to map to it.
#
# Example:
# currencies:
#   gold:
#     name: "Gold Coin"
#     symbol: "G"
#     texture: "gold_coin.png"
#   silver:
#     name: "Silver Piece"
#     symbol: "S"
#     # no texture defined, might use a default or be purely virtual
#   emeralds:
#     name: "Emeralds"
#     symbol: "E"
#     # This could represent the vanilla Emerald item if not using custom textures

currencies:
  gold:
    name: "Gold Coin"
    symbol: "G"
    texture: "textures/gold_coin.png" # Example path if you bundle textures
  silver:
    name: "Silver Piece"
    symbol: "S"
